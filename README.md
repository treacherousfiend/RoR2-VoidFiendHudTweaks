# Void Fiend Hud Tweaks

A collection of customizable tweaks for Void Fiend's corruption hud to hopefully make the convoluted mechanic a bit easier to understand for some people (aka me)

## To-Do

- Localization Support
- Setup setting change hooks so that code is completely skipped instead of checking if an option is enabled every frame
- Make the code a bit more modular so that hud elements can potentially be generated on the fly
